## Description

This code was completed as a task for the United Pallet Network. I was given 5 javascript tasks to complete, each with varying levels of difficulty.

The tasks are as follows:

- Task 1:
  Create a function that will halve a given number.

- Task 2:
  Create a function that will multiply two numbers together and add 3.

- Task 3:
  Create a function to calculate how many times 1000 needs to be halved to be less than 10.

- Task 4: Create a function that accepts an array of numbers and returns an array that has had all values above a given number removed.

- Task 5: Create a function to determine the winner of this card game.
  Two players are dealt five cards from a standard deck. The winner is the player with the best Hand.
